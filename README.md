# Commuter

![alt text](https://newsite.kochimetro.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/train.png)

Commuter is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'commuter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install commuter

For git gems, you'll need to run "bundle exec rerun -- rakup" instead of just "rackup".

## Usage

For now, this framework is not ready to use in production. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
